## About Manifold
Manifold is a distributed research group working on significantly improving AI systems and applying them to the toughest problems humanity faces. We do this by advancing theory and also building exceptional open source tools. We work in a different way to most other organizations, combining the strengths of focused research labs and large open source organizations. We also take a capabilities focused view of AI, and believe intelligent systems should have:
- **Multimodality**: Learning systems should be able to handle multiple objectives across multiple modalities.
- **Continual Learning**: They should be able to update and adapt to changing data over time.
- **Modularity and Composability**: Composability & Modularity leads to ease of reuse, fast adaptation, and human interpretability. 

We think if the above is achieved, there are numerous near term gains in various high impact applications.

## Current Projects
- [NEKO üêà](https://github.com/ManifoldRG/NEKO), an open source effort to build a massive generalist model capable of performing dozens of tasks across image, text, and control modalities.
- [AgentForge ‚öíÔ∏è](https://github.com/ManifoldRG/AgentForge) aims to build generic tools and models to rapidly build Intelligent Agents capable of digital tool use.
